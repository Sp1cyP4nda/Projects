## 🎴 Overview
**Minecraft the Gathering (MCtG)** is a Minecraft mod that allows you to import **Magic: The Gathering** cards as in-game items using the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api). Build decks by bundling cards together and shuffle them using in-game commands.

This mod is built for the **Fabric API** and is compatible with Minecraft **1.21.4**. It can be installed locally or on a server.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📥 `/mctg create <card_name>`  
  Import any Magic card from Scryfall into the game as a custom item.

- 🃏 Card items as paper  
  Imported cards use Minecraft’s paper item, with custom textures and metadata.

- 📦 Bundle support  
  You can store up to 99 cards in a bundle to represent a deck.

- 🔄 `/mctg shuffle`  
  Shuffle the cards in a bundle held in your main hand.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) for Minecraft 1.21.4.
2. Install the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).
3. Download and place the `mctg-<version>.jar` file into your `mods` folder.
4. Launch Minecraft using the Fabric profile.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Initialization (Run Once)

After installation, open your Minecraft world and run:
```bash
/mctg initialize
````

> This creates the backend folder structure used to store card data and textures.

---

### 🃏 Creating a Card

1. Hold a piece of paper in your main hand.
2. Use the command:

```bash
/mctg create <card_name>
```

**Formatting Tips:**

* Remove punctuation like apostrophes, commas, etc.
* Replace spaces with `_`, `-`, or remove them entirely

#### ✅ Examples

* `Jin-Gitaxias, Core Augur` → `/mctg create jin-gitaxias_core_augur` or `/mctg create jin_gitaxias_core_augur`
* `Bottomless Pool // Locker Room` → `/mctg create bottomless_pool`
* `Gossip's Talent` → `/mctg create gossips_talent`
* `Jin-Gitaxias // The Great Synthesis` → `/mctg create jin-gitaxias`

#### 🔁 Double-Faced Cards

* You will receive both front and back cards.
* Only the **front** will "fit" inside bundles (to prevent accidental inclusion of the back during shuffling).

### 🎨 Fixing Purple Textures

#### For **Local Installation**:

* Press `[F3] + [T]` to reload your resource packs after creating a card.

#### For **Servers**:

1. Compress your generated resource pack folder into a ZIP file.
2. Upload to a hosting site (e.g., [mc-packs.net](https://mc-packs.net)).
3. In `server.properties`, configure:

```properties
   resource-pack=https://your-link.com/resourcepack.zip
   resource-pack-sha1=<sha1_hash>
   require-resource-pack=true
```

4. Restart the server if needed.

> Note: hosting it in this way only works until the resource pack exceeds 50MB, at which point players will need to download the pack manually.

---

### 🔄 Shuffling the Deck

1. Hold a bundle with cards in your **main hand**.
2. Run:

```bash
/mctg shuffle
```

> If an error occurs, confirm that you are holding a bundle with card items.
