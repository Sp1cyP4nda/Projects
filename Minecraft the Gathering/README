This fabric mod can be installed onto a server or locally for your own games.
When you first install this mod, run `/mctg initialize` from the in-game chat window.
> This will create the backend directory structure used by the mod

To create a card:
- while holding paper in your main hand, type `/mctg create <card_name>`
- replace `<card_name>` with the name of the card with the following modifications:
1. For double sided cards, only use the front side
1a. For double cards, you can only use the card name on the left as it appears in online card databases
--> in other words, try the `/mctg create` command with one side of the card 
--> if that doesn't work, use the other side
2. Omit apostrophes and punctuations (commas, exclamation points, etc)
3. Change spaces to underscores (dashes can either be used or changed to underscores as well)
- wait for a few seconds until the paper changes
- Double sided cards will give you the back as a separate card
- Only the front can fit in the bundle
-> I made this decision so the backside can't accidentally get shuffled into the deck

Examples:
`Jin-Gitaxias, Core Augur` -> `/mctg create jin-gitaxias_core_augur` or `/mctg create jin_gitaxias_core_augur`
`Bottomless Pool // Locker Room` -> `/mctg create bottomless_pool`
`Gossip's Talent` -> `/mctg create gossips_talent`
`Jin-Gitaxias // The Great Synthesis` -> `/mctg create jin-gitaxias` or `/mctg create jin_gitaxias`

Now for the manual part
- If this is the first time a card is created, you will be left with a giant purple and black box
- If you are using this mod locally, just press [F3] + [T] to reload your resource packs and the cards will show
- If this is on a server, the resource pack has to be zipped and downloaded,
- then uploaded to a hosting site (I use mc-packs.net)
- Copy the "Download URL" and "SHA-1" entries into the server.properties file 
- make sure `require-resource-pack` is set to true
- restart the server

After these steps are followed, you should be ready to start playing

To shuffle the "deck:"
- hold the bundle containing the deck in your main hand
- into the chat, type `/mctg shuffle`
- if an error occurred, check to see if you are holding the bundle in your main hand
