This fabric mod can be installed onto a server or locally for your own games.
When you first install this mod, run `/mctg initialize` from the in-game chat window.
> This will create the backend directory structure used by the mod

To create a card:
- while holding paper in your main hand, type `/mctg create <card_name>`
- replace `<card_name>` with the name of the card with the following modifications:
1. Omit apostrophes and punctuations (commas, exclamation points, etc)
2. Change spaces to underscores or dashes (can also omit spaces altogether, if that's preferable)
- wait for a few seconds until the paper changes
- Double sided cards will give you the back as a separate card
- Only the front can fit in the bundle
-> I made this decision so the backside can't accidentally get shuffled into the deck

Examples:
`Jin-Gitaxias, Core Augur` -> `/mctg create jin-gitaxias_core_augur` or `/mctg create jin_gitaxias_core_augur`
`Bottomless Pool // Locker Room` -> `/mctg create bottomless_pool`
`Gossip's Talent` -> `/mctg create gossips_talent`
`Jin-Gitaxias // The Great Synthesis` -> `/mctg create jin-gitaxias` or `/mctg create jin_gitaxias`

Now for the manual part
- If this is the first time a card is created, you will be left with a giant purple and black box
- If you are using this mod locally, just press [F3] + [T] to reload your resource packs and the cards will show
- If this is on a server, the resource pack has to be zipped and downloaded,
- then uploaded to a hosting site (I use mc-packs.net)
- Copy the "Download URL" and "SHA-1" entries into the server.properties file 
- make sure `require-resource-pack` is set to true
- You shouldn't have to restart the server, but if the cards aren't loading, give that a shot

After these steps are followed, you should be ready to start playing

To shuffle the "deck:"
- hold the bundle containing the deck in your main hand
- into the chat, type `/mctg shuffle`
- if an error occurred, check to see if you are holding the bundle in your main hand
