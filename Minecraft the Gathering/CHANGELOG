02June25:
Fixed the permissions issue
    - Previously, only players with permissions 2 or higher could use `/mctg create`
Now checks to see if the player is holding only 1 paper
    - Previously, it only checked to see if a player was holding paper
    - This means if a player was holding a full stack of paper, `/mctg create` would turn the entire stack into a single card
No longer gives a free card with double-sided cards
    - Double-sided cards now require the player to hold a paper in their main hand and off hand
    - Previously, when using `/mctg create` on a double sided card, the held card would change to the desired card and that card's backside was given to the player
    - This could have potentially been abused
Card text is no longer italicized
`/mctg create` no longer creates .mcfunction files
Can now create a deck package
    - `/mctg initialize` creates a deck_bundle.mcfunction that can be called with `/mctg create deck_bundle`
    - Must be a player with permissions level 2 or higher
Server admins can also set a welcome package
    - Using a give command generator, server admins have the option to create a file called `welcome_package.mcfunction` that gives a welcome package to players with permissions 2 or higher when entering `/mctg create welcome_package` into the chat. This can be used to give welcome packages to players that are new to the server.
